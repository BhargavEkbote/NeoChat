## Reporting a Vulnerability

This section guides on how to report vulnerabilities.

Go to the issues section, and you are not guaranteed any updates, if a vulnerability is accepted then it will be patched and if it is declined it means that it was a false positive you dumbass, rest of it is something you should know.
